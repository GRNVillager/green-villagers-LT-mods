		Raccoon dog-morphs are usually found outside of the Dominion their thick and shaggy fur allows them to live more comfortably in colder climates compared to the more common races. It's commonly thought that they are be related to raccoon-morphs due to their physical similarities, but are actually more closely related to fox-morphs.

		A majority of raccoon dog-morphs are nomadic or living in small villages as they like to be surrounded by nature and prefer to wear as little clothing as they can. They are often seen forging, but a small minority have been found peddling their wares and services or congregating in a shrine.

		Like most other races, raccoon dog-morphs are affected by arcane storms and experience heightened libidos. Additionally there are reports that when directly stricken by Arcane Lighting during an Arcane Storm, their testicles rapidly grow up to eleven times its original size and will return its original size after 24 hours.

		A raccoon dog-morph's offspring will be a mixture of raccoon-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
